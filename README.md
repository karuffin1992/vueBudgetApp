# Budget App (Vue)

# What is Budget App?
The Budget App is to track what your current budget is.

The user is able to add all incomes and expenses that you have, totals it up to get your available budget.

Your expenses will show what percentage that each individual expense subtracts from your budget.

# Motivation
The Budget App was created during Jonas Schmedtmann's Complete JS Course 2019.

I wanted to learn Vue.js, so I decided to refactor Jonas's project from vanilla JS to Vue.js

# To Do list
- Create functionality to edit entries
- Play around with localStorage

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
